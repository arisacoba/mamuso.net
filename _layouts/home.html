    <h2>Hi,</h2>
    <p>I'm Manuel Mu√±oz Solera, and I work at Microsoft designing developer experiences. I spend most of my time thinking and talking with people who know much more than me. Seriously, isn't that great?</p>
    <p>I enjoy coding small, purposeful tools as much as I love drawing compulsively.</p>
    <p>If you are close to San Francisco, <a href="mailto:mamuso@mamuso.net">drop me a line!</a></p>
