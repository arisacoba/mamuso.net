    <h2>Hi,</h2>
    <p>I'm Manuel Muñoz Solera, and I work at Microsoft designing developer experiences. I spend most of my time thinking and talking with people who are way smarter than me. Seriously, isn't that great?</p>
    <p>I enjoy coding small, purposeful tools as much as I love drawing compulsively.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> was home for over four years. I was able to work in a broad range of problems, bringing a social layer to the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products.</p>
      <p>Working on our <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/YamUI/">design system</a> was a real treat.</p>
