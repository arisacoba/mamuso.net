    <h2>Hi,</h2>
    <p>My name is Manuel Muñoz Solera, and I'm a designer working for GitHub as their Director of Product Design. After
    designing many things for many years, I have found happiness and purpose in (developer) tools.<p>
    <p>I'm a lucky person. I learn new things every day and spend most of my time with smarter people than me. Isn't that great?</p>
    <p>If you want my recipe for cooking the spaghettiest code (my signature dish), or you want to say hi, don't be shy and <a href="mailto:mamuso@mamuso.net">drop me a line</a>.</p>

        <h3>Yammer</h3>
        <p>Principal designer (2013 — 2018) </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> was home for over four years. I was able to work on a broad range of problems, bringing a social layer to the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products.</p>
      <p>Working on our <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/YamUI/">design system</a> was a real treat.</p>

          <h3>Tuenti</h3>
          <p>Head of design (2010 — 2013)</p>
        </header>
        <p><a href="http://tuenti.com/">Tuenti</a> was born as a social network with a strong emphasis on chat communication and photos; by the time I joined the company, it was about to get out of its comfort zone and release a virtual mobile operator.</p>
        <p>My experience at this company was challenging and rewarding. Both businesses had radically different design needs, and that forced me to adapt and learn many new skills. I managed a fantastic group of human beings who taught me a lot about how to make things right and called me out when I did wrong.</p>

          <li>I had fun with some friends starting up our own small web design studio (2001-2005).</li>

          <li>I had a lot of fun building <a href="http://unvlog.com/">Unvlog</a> (2007) and <a href="http://iwannagothere.com/">Iwannagothere</a> (2008).</li>
          <li>I briefly touched base with <a href="https://jobandtalent.com/">Job&Talent</a> (2010).</li>
